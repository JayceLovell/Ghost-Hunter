## Summary

In this ARG (alternate reality game) players explore the Centennial College campus to catch ghosts. Players compete to collect all the ghosts and catalogue them in their ghost databank. Search for ghosts using your hightech ghost finder device. Follow the radar beeps to reveal the hiding ghost. To catch a ghost, players must complete a unique minigame challenge. Once completing the mini game only the winning player receives that ghost in their ghosts databank.
Catching Minigame
In order to capture ghosts, a minigame must be won for the player to add the ghost to their ghosts databank. The minigame is as follows:

The ghost runs around the screen trying to flee from the player. In order for the player to capture the ghost, the player must draw a complete circle around the ghost. Each complete circle around the ghost will weaken the ghost, until the health bar of the ghosts reaches zero. Once the health of the ghost reaches zero, the player has successfully captured the ghost. If the player fails to captured the ghost within the time limit, the player is unsuccessful in the capture, and the ghosts flees. Each ghost brings a unique element to the minigame, which brings challenge and difficulty.
